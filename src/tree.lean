/- Theorem 3: TFAE
    (a) T is a tree
    (b) There exists a unique path between any two distinct vertices of T
    (c) T is a connected graph on n vertices with n-1 edges
    (d) T is an acyclic graph on n vertices with n-1 edges -/

-- Proof outline:
/- Lemma 1: (a) → (b) : T is a tree → there exists a unique path between any two distinct vertices -/

begin
-- Subproof outline:
    -- let u,v be distinct vertices in T
    -- T is a tree, so a uv path p exists
        -- we already have uv path guaranteed by definition of tree
    intro h,
    cases h with hh hl,

        -- shit this is gonna be tricky
        -- (this doesn't cover the edge case that u is adjacent to v, which is false by the condition that we have a simple graph. this is a problem. fix the definition somehow)
    -- p.last = q.last, so we must have a vertex w' in p,q (could be v) such that (figure out how to say this correctly) w'.tail ∈ p ∧ w'.tail ∈ q (also this should probably be a path lemma)
    -- now, this means that we can build a path from w back to itself using the segments w to w' in p and q (do we have reversible paths in path.lean?)
    sorry,
end


/- Lemma 2: (b) → (c) : there exists a unique path between any two distinct vertices → T is connected on n vertices with n - 1 edges -/
-- note: no mention of T being a tree here, so that's not one of our assumptions (and can be used on any simple graph i think)
-- Subproof outline: (strong induction on V.card)
    -- Base Case: trivially true for V.card = 1, but that's because we have no edges
        -- this might be a problem - if we don't have loops, how can we say the individual vertex has a path to itself?
        -- maybe need to show it's true for V.card = 2?
    -- IH: assume the statement holds for V.card < n vertices
    -- let V.card = n
    -- let u,v be distinct vertices in T
    -- by assumption, a uv path p exists
    -- since p is unique, removing an edge x from p (and in fact the edge set of T. maybe new induced subgraph definition?) disconnects u from v
    -- the resultant graph contains two components H and K on vertex sets U and W, where U.card < n and W.card < n, so by IH we have U.card - 1 edges in H and W.card - 1 edges in K, and U.card + W.card = n - 1, which gives us n - 2 edges in H ∪ K. then adding back x, we have n - 1 edges in T.


/- Lemma 3: (c) → (d) : T is connected on n vertices with n - 1 edges → T is acyclic on n vertices with n - 1 edges -/
-- note: no mention of T being a tree here, so that's not one of our assumptions (and can be used on any simple graph)
-- Subproof outline:
    -- suppose for contradiction that T has a cycle C of length k ≥ 3.
    -- C contains k vertices and k edges (i think there are lemmas for this in path.lean)
    -- since k ≤ n (by (c)), there are n - k vertices in T that are not in C
    -- ∀ v : V, v ∉ C
        -- consider a path connecting v to a vertex in C
        -- each path will have at least 1 edge
        -- the number of edges connecting the rest of the vertices in V to those in C is at least n - k
        -- this means we have n - k + k = n ≤ edges in T, which is a contradiction

/- Lemma 4: (d) → (a) : T is acyclic on n vertices with n - 1 edges → T is a tree -/ 
-- note: this time we want to prove that T is a tree, so that's not one of our assumptions (and can be used on any simple graph)
-- Subproof outline:
    -- T is acyclic, V.card = n
    -- suppose T has k ≥ 1 components T1, T2, ... , Tk (oh boy finset time)
    -- since T is acyclic and components are connected, each Ti is a tree (say they're on Vi, and Vi.card = ni)
    -- since each Ti is a tree, we can use (a) → (b) → (c) to get that each Ti has ni - 1 edges
    -- therefore, T has ∑ (ni - 1) = (∑ ni) - k = n - k edges
    -- since n - k = n - 1, we have k = 1, so we have 1 component (which is connected by definition of component)
    -- the one component is all of T (make this a lemma about components)
    -- therefore T is acyclic and connected, and must be a tree

-- i guess make a bunch of iff lemmas out of that so i can rw stuff

-- make Prüfer codes
